This repository contains a collection of Python scripts demonstrating various use cases of OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) with Python. 
OpenCV is a powerful library that provides tools for image and video processing, computer vision, and machine learning applications.

### Introduction
OpenCV is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library, and it plays a significant role in various applications such as object detection, 
face recognition, image filtering, video analysis, and more. This repository aims to provide clear and concise examples of how to utilize OpenCV with Python to solve different computer vision tasks.

### Prerequisites
Before running the scripts in this repository, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- OpenCV (version 4.0 or higher)
- NumPy library

### Installation
To install OpenCV and other required dependencies, you can use pip:
'pip install opencv-python numpy'

### Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine using:
'git clone https://github.com/mazarzycki/OpenCV.git'
Navigate to the specific use case folder and execute the Python script to see the demonstration of that particular OpenCV use case.

### List of Use Cases
1. **Colors**: detects blue color on the camera image.
2. **Corners**: detects corners on the image.
3. **Face_eye**: detects face and eyes on the camera image.
4. **Videos**: shows how to flip the camera image and show it 4 times on the screen.
